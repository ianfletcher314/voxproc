Why it matches the VoxProc plugin color scheme:
----------------------------------------------
The VoxProc (Vocal Processor) plugin uses vibrant cool-toned colors:
- Background: Dark blue-purple (#1a1a2e)
- Compressor panel: Rich purple (#7b2d8e)
- De-Esser panel: Hot pink (#c44b8e)
- EQ panel: Teal green (#2d8e7b)
- Text: Light lavender (#f0f0ff)
- LED: Pink (#ff66aa)
- Meter Green: Mint (#66ffaa)
- LCD: Light mint (#aaffcc)

This tropical flower image features:
- Vibrant pink tones matching the de-esser panel and LED colors
- Purple undertones complementing the compressor section
- Soft organic feel appropriate for a vocal processing plugin
- Brazilian tropical aesthetic (orchids and exotic flowers native to Brazil)

Recommended usage:
- Apply with low opacity (10-15%) to add warmth without overwhelming
- The pink/purple palette enhances the feminine/vocal aesthetic
- Works especially well behind the de-esser section
- Creates a softer, more organic feel for vocal processing
